# Data Science Projects
These projects were completed during my Master in Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley. If the assignment was completed collaboratively as part of a group, it is noted. Below is a summary of projects and key skills used.

* Using [RAG](https://github.com/ritatu22/ritatu.github.io/tree/main/RAG) to Extract Information and Answer Questions
  * Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain
* [Flight Delay Predictions](https://github.com/ritatu22/ritatu.github.io/tree/main/Flight%20Delay%20Predictions%20using%20Machine%20Learning) using Machine Learning
  * logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, ensemble method, Apache Spark
* [Patent Binary Classification](https://github.com/ritatu22/ritatu.github.io/tree/main/Patent%20Classification%20Project) using Deep Learning
  * Na√Øve-Bayes, BERT
* [Waste Classification](https://github.com/ritatu22/ritatu.github.io/tree/main/Waste%20Classification) using Machine Learning
  * logistic regression, random forest, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and ResNet50
